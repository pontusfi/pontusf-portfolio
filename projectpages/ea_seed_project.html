    <h1>EA SEED — Hierarchical AI for Smarter NPCs</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Combining the strategic strengths of LLMs with the fast reflexes of RL to create smarter, more adaptive NPCs. </p>

  <!-- Overview -->
  <section class="project-overview section glass">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project is to develop intelligent, adaptive NPCs for games by combining Reinforcement 
      Learning (RL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) in a hierarchical system. RL agents handle fast, 
      low-level behaviors such as navigation and combat, while the LLM oversees strategic decision-making and 
      orchestrates which RL agents to activate based on the game state.</p>

  <!-- Features -->
  <section class="project-features section">
    <h2>Features (In Progress)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Hierarchical AI Control: Combining an LLM for strategy with RL agents for fast, low-level actions.</li>
      <li>Adaptive NPC Behavior: NPCs can switch between sub-behaviors (e.g. defensive, aggressive) based on game state.</li>
      <li>Smarter & Faster Gameplay: Balances long-term planning with real-time responsiveness for more engaging NPCs.</li>
      
    </ul>

  <section class="project-challenges section glass">
    <h2>My Role & Challenges (In Progress)</h2>
    <p>In Progress: In this EA SEED project, my primary role is setting up the training environment in 
      Unity and preparing RL agents for training. The next steps involve developing sub-behaviours 
      (defensive, aggressive) using RL and connecting them to an LLM controller for strategic decision-making.
