    <h1>RNN and LSTM - Text Synthesis</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Evaluating and comparing performance of a vanilla RNN and LSTM neural network for text synthesis</p>
  </header>

  <!-- Overview -->
  <section class="project-overview section glass">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project explores the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) for character-level text generation, 
      using a dataset of Shakespeare’s plays. We implemented both a vanilla RNN and an LSTM, comparing their performance in terms of training, validation, 
      and test losses, as well as the quality of the generated text. Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and sequence length were optimized 
      through grid search. We also investigated the impact of hidden state dimensionality on model performance. Evaluation included quantitative metrics 
      like n-gram accuracy and spelling correctness, alongside qualitative assessment by reading the generated text. The results indicate that LSTMs outperform vanilla RNNs, 
      demonstrating a superior ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data.</p>

    <h2>My Role & Challenges</h2>
    <p>I mostly acquired skills in how to use the PyTorch library more extensively for this kind of task. 
      Previously I had implemented a RNN model from scratch just using Python. That meant implemeting everything from scratch, such as the forward pass and backprop algorithm.
      In this project I worked on implementing this type of network using PyTorch and adapting it to our project. This also involved writing the functionality to synthesize synthesize text.
       Along with this I have also gained a better understanding of LSTMs and how they work. Also I worked quite extensively on analyzing 
      and searching for the best hyperparameters for our network. In this case i implemented a grid search and deciding what hyperparameter to tweak and what values 
      to search for. After finding best parameters I also worked on analyzing the networks performance during training in order to find how many epochs we should use in the end. 
      During this process I learned a lot about how the parameters can affect the networks performance and also about how the dimensionality of the hidder layer affects the result. 
      Lastly I have also greatly increased my understanding of the principles behind word2vec and BPE even though I was not the main person implementing it.</p>
