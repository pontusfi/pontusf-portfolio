    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Built a lightweight CI server from scratch to master the core principles of continuous integration. 
      The project implements essential CI features such as automated build triggering via webhooks, 
      build execution, and status reporting. Developed collaboratively using GitHub for version control
      , issues, and pull requests. Emphasized clean architecture and sound software engineering practices throughout the development process. </p>

  <section class="project-features section">
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Webhook integration – triggers builds on new commits pushed to GitHub</li>
      <li>Automated build execution – compiles and tests code automatically on each trigger</li>
      <li>Commit status reporting – sends build results back to the repository via REST</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Challenges -->
  <section class="project-challenges section glass">
    <h2>My Role & Challenges</h2>
    <p>I was responsible for implementing the commit status reporting feature. This involved integrating 
      with the GitHub REST API to programmatically set the status of each commit based on build results, 
      enabling clear feedback directly within the repository. I also developed unit tests to verify the 
      correctness and reliability of this functionality, ensuring accurate status updates and robust error 
      handling.
