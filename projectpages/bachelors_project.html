    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project I conducted a user study together with Alexander Gemal in order to try and compare the impacts
          of visual and auditory feedback in FPS games and how they impact player performance. This consisted of creating
        a small FPS game in unity acting as our test environment and then conducting the user tests. </p>

    <h2>My Role & Challenges</h2>
    <p>In the start of the project I worked a lot on getting our test game in Unity working according to our specifications.
      For me this mostly included working on the level design for our test levels. Furthermore the initial phase of the
       thesis involved a lot of research into user interfaces (UI) and Audio in video games and their role in the player 
       experience. The rest of the time was spent on conducting user studies and analyzing the results and then composing the
        final report.
