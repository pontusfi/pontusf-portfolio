    <h2>My Role & Challenges</h2>
    <p> During this project, I focused heavily on developing the Presenters and Views within the MVP architecture, 
      ensuring a clean separation of concerns and maintainable code. I also implemented much of the routing logic 
      and configured the React Router setup for seamless navigation. In addition, I was responsible for 
      establishing data persistence using Firebase. This included configuring the backend and implementing 
      functionality to store and retrieve data from the database.
